An email sequence (aka campaign) is a series of pre-scheduled emails designed to guide recipients through a specific journey, whether it's welcoming new subscribers, promoting a product, or re-engaging inactive customers. 

By strategically planning each email, you can provide valuable content, build trust, and encourage actions that align with your business goals.
